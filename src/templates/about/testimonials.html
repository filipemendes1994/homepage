          <div>I’ll be detailing my working relationship with Filipe regarding the time I managed the Design Team at Shift APPens a couple of years ago.</div>

          <div>
            Working with young people is a challenge and so is organizing an event. When you put these two things together, even greater are the hardships of what you try to accomplish.

          </div>

          <div class="more">
            <div>
              With Filipe’s understanding of these difficulties, he was able to successfully coordinate a multidisciplinary team composed of people from two distinct organizations (NEI and jeKnowledge).
            </div>

            <div>
              His efforts in keeping an organized workforce and planning before acting were fruitful, as was the final result: a brilliant event of which we - the organizing team - are extremely proud of having been a part of.
            </div>

            <div>
              Due to the fact that our relationship is not only professional but also personal, I can certainly and without a doubt say he is a valuable asset wherever he stands - be it as a Software Engineer or as a higher level manager.
            </div>

            <div>
              I’m proud to be his friend and look forward to his achievements in the near and distant future.

          <div>Filipe and I have quite a story together.</div>
          <div>
            We started as simple colleagues studying on the same bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering at the University of Coimbra, and since then we've been through a lot of different stuff together, some more relaxing, funny and lighter experiences, others way more serious, harder and impactful ones.
          </div>

          <div>
            But eventually, these two simple colleagues became best friends.
            <span class="dots">...</span>
          </div>

          <div class="more">
            <div>
              Why is this important you may ask? Because everybody knows friends tell other folks the nicest things possible but best friends tell the truth.
            </div>

            <div>
              And the truth is Filipe is one of the most professional, committed and hard-working persons I've ever met and had the lucky chance to work with. His personal values/beliefs of honesty, transparency, fairness, and justice make him an individual that will always make a difference, no matter what the project/team/organization might be.
            </div>

            <div>
              That's what I can say about Filipe, even though he's a kickass software engineer, he's even a much better person and human being, he's the team player that everyone wants on their team, and personally, I can't wait to work with him again.

          <div>Filipe is an excellent professional, extremely dedicated, responsible and resilient. Front-end is his specialty.</div>
          <div>
            His major technical skills of computer science are linked to a desire to do better and to make every project go further, along with an high level team spirit. It is always a pleasure to work with someone like Filipe.
